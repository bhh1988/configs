Hopefully copypaste.xpi won't need to be udpated often, but just in case:

Important contents are platformHTMLBindings.xml and browser.xul.

platformHTMLBindings.xml
This comes from unzipping /usr/lib/firefox/omni.ja and looking at
chrome/toolkit/content/global/platformHTMLBindings.xml, replacing the relevant
keybinding modifiers to be "accel,shift" instead of "accel."

browser.xul
This comes from unzipping /usr/lib/firefox/browser/omni.ja and looking at
chrome/browser/content/browser/browser.xul. Grep for PageSource and find the
relevant keybinding lines for the View:PageSource and View:PageInfo commands.
These were overridden because sometimes they seem to be invoked when I press
Ctrl+U and Ctrl+I for kill-line and forward commands.

After modifying those two files and putting them in our own extensions path
at "extensions/copypaste/chrome/content", inside of extensions/copypaste run:

`zip -r copypaste.xpi *`

And load this Firefox add-on from Firefox using the "Install Add-on From File"
option in the add-ons page.
